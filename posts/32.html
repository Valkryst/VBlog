                <p>
                    As someone who is actively trying to learn more about PowerShell, to advance beyond the level of a novice,
                    I purchased this book with the assumption that it would provide a foundation for further research and
                    learning. It was sufficient for both purposes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The authorâ€™s writing is clear, generally to the point, and there are enough examples to help the reader
                    follow along without needing to sit and type along. Though I was able to find this
                    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220407141510/https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30CGTVDP6VOCZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1593279183">review</a>
                    which noted that there are (or were) several mistakes in the examples.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing that I did not like was the chapter on testing with Pester. It was about four pages long, barely
                    taught anything, and it was clearly added as a schill for another
                    <a href="https://leanpub.com/pesterbook" target="_blank">book</a> by the same author. This chapter fails
                    to teach the reader how to properly test their code and it should have either been omitted or expanded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For those with experience, I recommend this book as a quick introduction to PowerShell and some of its
                    use cases. However, I do not recommend it for those without prior coding experience as they may benefit
                    from a slower, more structured introduction to the language and programming/scripting in general.
                </p>
