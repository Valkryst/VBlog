                <p>The paper “AI for Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Games” by Hunicke and Chapman states that “Video
                    Games are boring when they are too easy and frustrating when they are too hard.” and that, through
                    the use of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA), a game can be tailored to fit the experience and
                    capabilities of each player as they progress through the game. This method of balance not only
                    allows players of any experience-level to better enjoy the game, but it also enhances
                    re-playability. </p>
                <p>Players of all experience-levels, ranging from those who have never played a game before to
                    professional eSports competitors, are all unique. Each player has their own play-style and knowledge
                    which plays a role in dictating how well they perform in any given game. Many game designers take
                    this into account through the use of various pre-set difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and
                    hard when designing their game. These difficulty levels can affect elements such as the frequency of
                    health/ammo drops and enemy strength. Though pre-set difficulty levels are a tried and true method
                    of catering to a wide variety of players, they are not the best possible solution in every case. For
                    example, imagine a procedurally generated endless-runner game similar to <em>Temple Run</em> where
                    the player must navigate a unique level comprised of various obstacles and maze-like paths to reach
                    some goal. In this example, it may make sense to allow the player to choose from easy, medium, or
                    hard levels and to create a unique generation algorithm, or customization of a single algorithm, for
                    each option, but these three presets can also be augmented or replaced by a dynamic difficulty
                    adjustment (DDA) algorithm. Instead of allowing the player to choose which difficulty they would
                    rather play on, the game can begin with an untrained DDA algorithm that slowly tests the player’s
                    response times, success rates on overcoming each obstacle, reaching specific milestones or goals,
                    and various other metrics. As the DDA algorithm is trained on the player’s specific metrics, it will
                    automatically make adjustments to the&nbsp;spawn rates of certain obstacles, enemies, level size,
                    required response/reaction times, and other variables of the procedural generation algorithm.
                    Adjustments to the procedural algorithm will then cause the game to increase or lessen in difficulty
                    as the player’s experience-level increases, decreases, or possibly when the player begins to fail
                    too often. With a well written DDA algorithm, the game will keep the player in a constant flow state
                    where “Challenge and pacing must ramp to match skill, in order to support continued engagement.”
                    (Hunicke &amp; Chapman)</p>
                <p>Re-playability is often a forethought in game design and there are many techniques, which involve
                    some form of procedural or randomized elements, that can be utilized and combined to create an
                    enjoyable and uniquely re-playable experience. The previously described <em>Temple Run</em>-eqsue
                    game is one example where a procedural technique or techniques, in this case procedural level
                    generation, can be used to to give the player a unique experience on every re-play. Although
                    procedural generation is a large topic and there are countless ways to implement such techniques, it
                    is useful to take into consideration the benefit of a DDA algorithm used in-conjunction with
                    procedural techniques. As previously stated, adjustments to the parameters of a procedural level
                    generation algorithm, such as the spawn rates of certain obstacles, enemies, and level size, can be
                    performed by a DDA algorithm to affect the difficulty of each level as the player is playing through
                    it either in real-time or between levels. Through use of these adjustments, the DDA algorithm is
                    effectively ensuring that each re-play of the game is not only unique, as guaranteed by the
                    procedural algorithm, but that each re-play is both a challenge to the player to increase his or her
                    skills and to provide an enjoyable experience that is neither frustrating or dull. As Missura et.
                    al. have stated “The perceived difficulty of the game also contributes to the time that any given
                    player spends playing it. Games that are too easy or too difficult become boring or frustrating
                    fast.”</p>
                <p>In their paper, Hunicke and Chapman are primarily working within the area of game balancing and how
                    it can be done through the use of an automated system to cater specifically to each unique player.
                    Traditional game balancing, as can be used with pre-set difficulty levels, is where “Game developers
                    iteratively refine these systems based on play testing feedback – tweaking behaviors and settings
                    until the game is balanced.” (Hunicke &amp; Chapman). As many game developers and, more
                    specifically, programmers may learn at one point or another, deciding the actual values to be used
                    in a game based off of game design documentation is difficult. Terms such as “High Damage”, “Very
                    Fast Attack”, and “Slow Movement” are vague and mean nothing until a “Normal” set of values is
                    decided upon. Without expressed integer or decimal values, the programmer is incapable of creating a
                    proper balance between, for example, enemy health and player attack damage. In a situation such as
                    this, the values inserted into the game may simply be an educated guess as to what could work. By
                    implementing some form of DDA algorithm, both the design team and the programmer can exchange the
                    stress, work, and costs associated with iterative game balancing for the stress, work, and costs
                    associated with developing a working DDA algorithm. An exchange such as this must be carefully
                    analyzed as the work and costs associated with DDA development may outweigh those of traditional
                    balancing. Games such as <em>Bejeweled</em>, <em>Solitaire</em>, and <em>Chess</em> may not benefit
                    much from a DDA algorithm due to their simple and deterministic nature, but <em>Counter Strike:
                        Global Offensive</em>, <em>&nbsp;Torchlight II</em>, and <em>Diablo 3</em> may be able to offer
                    a more challenging, varied, and fresh replay experience if a DDA algorithm is utilized.</p>
                <p>In conclusion,&nbsp; a game can be tailored to fit the experience and capabilities of each player as
                    they progress through the game by use of a dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) algorithm. Players of
                    all experience levels can benefit from uniquely adjusted game play as the adjustments will ensure
                    that players remain in a constant flow state which will increase both player enjoyment and therefore
                    player retention. Though traditional iterative balancing is a tried and true method, it is not
                    applicable to every game. DDA adjustment algorithms are a useful tool a game such as <em>Counter
                        Strike: Global Offensive</em>, <em>&nbsp;Torchlight II</em>, and <em>Diablo 3</em> where the
                    player’s skill, equipment, and other factors can cause the challenge of the game to greatly lessen
                    over time. A DDA algorithm, if properly utilized, is a powerful tool which is potentially able to
                    save hundreds of man-hours of iterative game balancing. </p>
