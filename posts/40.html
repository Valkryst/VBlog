                    Before purchasing this
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Building-Browser-Extensions-Create-Firefox/dp/148428724X" target="_blank">book</a>,
                    you should have a good grasp of JavaScript as well as knowledge of HTML and
                    CSS. I would not recommend this book otherwise, because it would take significantly more time to learn
                    from and you may not retain or learn as much as you could.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From what little I knew of browser extension development beforehand, I feel confident in saying that this
                    book will jump-start your development efforts and position you for success. Though the book is partially a
                    guide for learning extension development, it quickly devolves into more of a reference manual
                    which may eventually be discarded in favour of web searches or
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" target="_blank">MDN documentation</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My main gripes with this book are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The text is too large and causes code examples to be separated into multiple pages, which made it
                        a tad more difficult to read. This happens in many books, but it could have easily been 		mitigated with a smaller font size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bold text is overused. This may be a personal issue, but it does make it more difficult for me to
                        separate sections of the text and I often found my eyes skipping ahead to see what the next piece
                        of bolded information was.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Following my first point, the overall layout of text, code examples, and images felt muddled. You
                        might read a paragraph, see two or three pages of examples, and then the continuing text. I do not
                        have a perfect answer for how to fix this, but maybe the code and examples could be pushed to the end
                        of each chapter and the text itself could include references to the sections or page numbers of where
                        to find the code.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Overall, I would recommend this book to someone who is just starting to learn browser extension development,
                    but I would caution them with the above points and further recommend that they have a project to work on
                    while they read through the book.
