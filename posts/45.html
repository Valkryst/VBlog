                <p>
                    Assuming you have the time to read through
                    <a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-canadians-guide-to-investing/9781119609957-item.html" target="_blank">this book</a>,
                    you are likely better off searching the web or calling an advisor to answer your questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this book were 5-10$, then I might be inclined to recommend it as a high-level overview of investment options available to
                    Canadians, but it only covers each topic to a point where you know what it is and a little bit about it. There is no depth to
                    the book, and it costs around 20$ after tax, so I do not recommend buying it.
                </p>

                    As a side note, the <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com/getting-started" target="_&quot;blank&quot;">Canadian Couch Potato</a> site
                    is a useful reference for those who want simple, to the point, investment advice for the average Canadian.
