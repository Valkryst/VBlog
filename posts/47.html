                <p>
                    <a href="https://jcip.net" target="_blank">This book</a> is old, long, and tiring to read through. It took me the
                    better part of two weeks to read and I still feel that I should have read more slowly and carefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nearly everything that I knew about concurrent programming, prior to reading this book, was covered in detail and
                    expanded upon. That includes all of the information taught to me in University as well as many tidbits that I picked
                    up since then. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about concurrent programming and
                    I also recommend it as a reference manual or a refresher.
                </p>

                    Though I have high praise for this book, it is not without its faults. In no particular order, here are my thoughts
                    on what could be improved:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A new edition should be released. There have been many changes and additions to the JVM/JDK since the book was
                        released in 2006 and it would be great to have an authorative reference which touches on as much
                        of the ecosystem as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Much of the text references examples ahead or behind the current page. I often found myself quickly
                        flipping between two pages while trying to comprehend what the author is saying and what the example is
                        showing. I believe it would be beneficial to revise the book's formatting to move examples closer to the text
                        which references them, specifically by having them on the same page if possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At times I found myself glossing over paragraphs of exposition and having to re-read from the beginning. It
                        was likely due to the technical nature of what was being covered, in that it required a lot of explanation to
                        ensure the reader understands what is being taught. However, I believe the book could be somewhat condensed
                        or rewritten in a slightly less dry manner.
                    </li>
                </ol>
