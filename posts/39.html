                    Whether you are a professional  looking to learn or refresh your knowledge of PostgreSQL, or a student who
                    is learning about databases for the first time,
                    <a href="https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition" target="_blank">this book</a>
                    <em>may</em> be a good resource for you.

                <p>
                    The book covers almost everything, regarding databases and SQL, that I had learned during my University
                    degree. From <i>SELECT</i>, <i>JOIN</i>, and <i>COPY</i> to working with GIS data, performing
                    maintenance, and DB backup/restoration. Additionally, it is rife with explanations, examples, and the
                    occasional pointer to external resources. You could likely read through it all without ever touching
                    Google.

                    Though I have a lot of praise for this book, I did find it a bit tedious to read through from start to
                    finish. I think it would be better used as a reference manual, after a quick glance at the first few pages
                    of each chapter. However, for students or those just learning aboout databases and PostgreSQL, I would
                    recommend reading it in its entirety. There is a lot to learn and the author does a good job at explaining
                    things.
