                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Since the release of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, there has been a
                    rush to develop frameworks, platforms, and tools to aid in the development of
                    AI, LLM, and ML backed solutions. Over the past three weeks, I have spent time
                    with <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://aws-blogs-artifacts-public.s3.amazonaws.com/ML-15986/AmazonBedrock_UserGuide.pdf">Amazon’s
                        Bedrock</a>, Azure’s <a target="_blank"
                                                href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry?tabs=home">AI
                        Foundry</a>, Google’s <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs">Dialogflow
                        CX</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs">Vertex AI</a>. As
                    my research time was limited, I focused on
                    documentation, UI, and three powerful features which are present in most of
                    these products: Agents, Flows, and Knowledge Bases.</p>

                <p>Originally, I intended to evaluate Microsoft Azure’s AI
                    Foundry along with the products from both Amazon and Google. However, AI
                    Foundry was <a target="_blank"
                                   href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/announcing-general-availability-of-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service/4414352">generally
                        released</a> about two weeks ago, as of the time of writing, and I cannot
                    fairly evaluate it in its current state. Many of its features are marked with the “PREVIEW”
                    designation and I frequently
                    ran into UI problems which prevented me from using the product as intended. I was
                    pleasantly surprised at the quality of AI Foundry’s documentation and
                    particularly enjoyed the ability to select which programming language to
                    display the code examples in. Additionally, the UI is clean, simple, easy to
                    use, and I believe that it will <i>eventually</i> become a worthwhile product.</p>

                <p>As a side note, both Dialogflow CX and Vertex AI are soon™
                    being consolidated into Google’s <a target="_blank"
                                                        href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/console-conversational-agents">Conversational
                        Agents console</a>. The terminology and product names, used here, may change.</p>

                <h2>Documentation</h2>

                <p>Documentation is important. Poorly documented projects are
                    difficult to learn and adopt, frustrating to work with, and <i>will</i> cost
                    your company and/or clients a significant amount of money in
                    the long run. The skills and experience required to write good
                    documentation are not developed overnight, and
                    documentation is often thrown to the wayside in-favour of more rapid
                    development.</p>

                <p>With massive financial backing and access to the world’s top
                    talent, industry giants such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have <i>no</i>
                    excuse for providing poor quality documentation. There should be no tolerance
                    for it.</p>

                <p>Google’s Dialogflow CX is where my research began. Its
                    documentation is somewhat good, and I found it to be both accessible and
                    readable. Features often provided links to their associated documentation, and it
                    is organized in a way which makes it easy to navigate
                    without resorting to the search field. The documentation uses simple, clear
                    language with heavy use of numbered lists and links to other pages and
                    documentation. However, there is a lack of full, working examples and it can be
                    difficult to test that certain features work without a fair bit of experimentation
                    and guesswork. As the product is <a target="_blank"
                                                        href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/release-notes">still
                        receiving
                        updates</a>, I have hope that their documentation will further improve over
                    time.</p>

                <p>Similarly to Dialogflow CX’s documentation, Google’s Vertex
                    AI suffers from a lack of full, working examples. Its documentation is also scattered, missing
                    information, and tedious to learn
                    from. When I first approached the product, I thought that it had a supported
                    Java SDK even though <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs">the
                        documentation</a> only gave examples using its Python SDK. <a target="_blank"
                                                                                      href="https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-aiplatform/latest/overview">These</a>
                    <a target="_blank"
                       href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reference/java/latest/overview">two</a>
                    pages linked to <a target="_blank"
                                       href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/tree/main/java-aiplatform">these</a>
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/tree/main/java-vertexai">two</a>
                    GitHub repositories which host two recently updated Java SDKs. What is the
                    difference between them, what are they capable of, why are they in separate
                    documentation areas, and how can I use them with Vertex AI? I do not know,
                    because the documentation did not tell me. This was a recurring theme as I
                    tried to learn and use Vertex AI, and it was <i>frustrating</i>.</p>

                <p>An interesting product, which I stumbled upon while playing
                    with Vertex AI, is Google’s <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.google/">Colab</a>. It is a free,
                    hosted version of <a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> on
                    Google’s Cloud Platform. As a fan of Jupyter Notebook, I had a great experience
                    with Colab and it allowed me to quickly run the code in Vertex AI’s
                    documentation. Though Colab is a capable platform to develop an agent with, I
                    was unable to find any documentation describing how to deploy an agent on
                    Vertex AI from it. This seems like a missed opportunity as it could help to streamline
                    development.</p>

                <p>As I once worked for an <a target="_blank" href="https://business.amazon.ca/en/partners">Amazon
                    Business Partner</a>, I am biased towards their documentation. I hold it in high
                    regard as a standard for how accessible, detailed, and readable that cloud
                    provider documentation can be. I am sure that their documentation has its
                    faults, but I have not yet run into any notable problems. </p>

                <p>Bedrock’s documentation was a breath of fresh-air, after the
                    frustration I felt while working with Vertex AI. As with Dialogflow CX, Bedrock
                    often provides direct links to a feature’s associated documentation, it is organized for easy
                    navigation, its language is clear, and
                    there are relevant links to other sections of the documentation. The key
                    difference is that Bedrock’s documentation appears much more thorough and
                    detailed. I came out of the Bedrock documentation with far fewer questions than
                    I did with either of Google’s services.</p>

                <h2>User Interface/Experience</h2>

                <p>Dialogflow CX seems to have originally been
                    created for the low-code development of telephony systems. As these
                    systems can benefit from the use of LLMs, Google has rightfully incorporated
                    them into their pre-existing product. At a high level, Dialogflow CX appears
                    capable of everything that Bedrock is. However, Azure’s AI Foundry (<a target="_blank"
                                                                                           href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/announcing-general-availability-of-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service/4414352"
                                                                                           target="_blank">2025</a>),
                    Amazon’s Bedrock (<a target="_blank"
                                         href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-amazon-bedrock-general-availability-generative-ai-innovations"
                                         target="_blank">2023</a>), and Vertex AI (<a target="_blank"
                                                                                      href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/release-notes#September_21_2020"
                                                                                      target="_blank">2019</a>) were
                    released much more recently than the original
                    Dialogflow (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogflow"
                                   target="_blank">2014</a>).They
                    have had the benefit of learning from its mistakes. All of this is to say that
                    Dialogflow CX is powerful, but appears hampered by old design decisions which
                    have led to a cumbersome user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).</p>

                <p>Unlike documentation, the UI and UX of large products can
                    become difficult to change as time goes on. Updating them can sometimes cause
                    confusion and even outrage in longtime users, and it can be seen
                    as a development burden which may not be worth investing in. From the
                    perspective of someone who has just been introduced to
                    Dialogflow CX, I believe that it needs more love, care, and effort put into its
                    UI and UX if it hopes to continue competing with Bedrock and AI Foundry. Google
                    is a multi-billion-dollar company and they can afford the resources required to
                    accomplish this.</p>

                <p>As an example of Dialogflow CX’s cumbersome design, look at
                    the flow feature which both it and Bedrock offer. Both products have a
                    node-based UI. In my experience, this type of UI usually allows the user to add
                    or drag-and-drop new nodes onto a canvas, drag and rearrange existing nodes, and
                    connect nodes together by dragging a line between one node’s output and another’s
                    input. Bedrock follows this pattern, but Dialogflow CX does not.</p>

                <p>In Dialogflow CX, the user must navigate through multiple,
                    nested menus to create, configure, and connect nodes together. There is
                    seemingly no affordance for the user to interactively perform these actions. This
                    is a common theme for the UI and UX of Dialogflow CX’s features, and it greatly
                    increases the cognitive load required to work with them. In comparison, Bedrock’s
                    UI and UX is much more straightforward in that it simplifies Flow development
                    by enabling the expected interactive actions. While Bedrock also makes use of
                    nested menus to configure nodes once they have been selected,
                    the menus are far less cluttered and are easier to understand. Care has been put into how Bedrock’s
                    menu and configuration options
                    are laid out, with irrelevant configuration options being hidden until the user
                    makes specific selections which require them to be shown.</p>

                <p>With their more recent releases, AI Foundry, Bedrock, and Google’s
                    own Vertex AI have not suffered from the UI and UX problems present in
                    Dialogflow CX. While visually distinct, each of them has a straightforward UI
                    and provides a relatively painless UX. From a developer’s standpoint, I have no
                    complaints worth mentioning. </p>

                <h2>Agents</h2>

                <p>Agents, known as Playbooks in Dialogflow CX, are
                    configurable LLMs which are generally capable of data retrieval and storage,
                    calling functions and tools, working with APIs which support the <a target="_blank"
                                                                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification">OpenAPI
                        specification</a>, and<a target="_blank"
                                                 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation">
                        retrieval
                        augmented generation (RAG)</a>.</p>

                <p>A conversation between a user and an agent is called a session. Each product enables its agents to
                    resume past sessions and to refer to information within them. Both Bedrock and
                    Dialogflow CX can save a session for up to <a target="_blank"
                                                                  href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/session">24
                        hours</a>
                    or <a target="_blank"

                        days</a> respectively. Optionally, Bedrock can generate and store a summary of the
                    conversation instead. Of the three products, Vertex AI offers the most
                    flexibility with its <a target="_blank"
                                            href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/sessions/manage-sessions-api?hl=en">session
                        management API</a> and it may also be able to save a session indefinitely, as its
                    documentation does not specify a <a target="_blank"
                                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live">time to
                        live</a>.</p>

                <p>Though their session management features are similar, the
                    products diverge in their ability to call functions, tools, and in how they use
                    OpenAPIs. They each appear equivalently capable, but
                    the amount of work required to achieve the same goal in each is highly variable
                    and depends on your specific use case.</p>

                <p>Google’s products provide numerous methods of integration
                    with 3<sup>rd</sup> party services such as Oracle, Paypal,
                    Salesforce, and Stripe. Integrations that an agent can directly, dynamically
                    use are called tools. Dialogflow CX is <a target="_blank"
                                                              href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/playbook/tool#built-in">limited</a>
                    in its selection of tools, whereas Vertex AI offers <a target="_blank"
                                                                           href="https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/">seemingly
                        limitless</a>
                    integrations through its support for OpenAPI, <a target="_blank"
                                                                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">MCP</a>,
                    and other tools.
                    While Bedrock does not currently appear to offer 3<sup>rd</sup> party integrations
                    VIA tools, it does allow you to write them yourself. Bedrock also supports <a target="_blank"
                                                                                                  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-computer-use.html">agent-controlled
                        use of the user’s computer</a> as well as the ability to <a target="_blank"
                                                                                    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-code-interpretation.html">generate
                        and run code to dynamically respond to a user’s prompt</a>.</p>

                <p>In addition to tools, all agents can connect to multiple
                    knowledge bases for RAG. The lack of a specific tool integration in a product
                    may be compensated for by its support for that service
                    in building a knowledge base that the agent can make use of.</p>

                <h2>Knowledge Bases</h2>

                <p>A knowledge base, known as a datastore in Dialogflow CX or
                    corpus in Vertex AI, allow agents to perform RAG by providing them with data
                    VIA a defined interface such as those used to connect with vector, SQL, and graph
                    databases. Common data sources include folders and files, scraped websites, and
                    data pulled from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party such as JIRA or Salesforce.</p>

                <p>As with agents, there are many differences in the supported
                    data sources, file types, and in both parsing and chunking of the data. With so
                    many differences, it is infeasible to list them here while also keeping them up
                    to date with future changes. To that end, the following links are a good starting
                    point for determining whether a particular product supports your use case. </p>

                <h2>Flows</h2>

                <p>Flows are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state
                    machines</a> which perform a set of actions to achieve a
                    goal. The allowed set of actions varies with each cloud provider. You can typically
                    chain-together multiple agents in-sequence to converse and retrieve data from a
                    user, to call other services to perform actions, to transform data VIA code or
                    an LLM, and to retrieve and store data.</p>

                <p>Both Bedrock and
                    Dialogflow CX support flows and provide a node-based UI for creating and
                    editing them. Aside from the differences mentioned above, their flow features
                    are similar and similarly capable. Vertex AI does not have this feature, but
                    its agents are fully programmable and can perform a flow-like series of steps.</p>

                <h2>Deployment</h2>
                <p>In Bedrock and Dialogflow CX, agents and flows can be
                    versioned and multiple varying versions deployed alongside each other. Knowledge
                    Bases do not appear to have this ability, but they can sometimes be
                    periodically, automatically updated depending on the source of their data. Vertex
                    AI does not explicitly support versioning, but it appears possible as two
                    agents can be deployed with two differing codebases.</p>

                <p>Though each product requires a different set of steps for
                    deployment (<a target="_blank"
                                   href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-deploy.html">Bedrock</a>,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/integration">Dialogflow
                        CX</a>, <a target="_blank"
                                   href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/deploy?hl=en">Vertex
                        AI</a>), they are similar overall. You define which version of an agent or flow
                    to deploy, follow the deployment steps, and then update your integration to use
                    the new deployment.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>If you are developing a telephony system or a simple
                    text-based chat bot, then I would consider Dialogflow CX along with additional
                    research into other products in that domain. I hesitate to recommend it for
                    other use cases as its documentation, UI, and UX make it difficult to reason
                    about and work with. For all other use cases, I recommend evaluating Bedrock or
                    Vertex AI.</p>
                <p>For freeform development with few restrictions, Vertex AI is
                    an appropriate choice. Its agents are entirely programmatic, so you should be
                    able to do nearly anything with it. Its various integrations and supporting products
                    also make it an appealing choice.</p>
                <p>Amazon’s Bedrock is my go-to recommendation overall, but I
                    would ideally love to use a product which combines Bedrock’s documentation and
                    node-based flow creation UI with Vertex AI’s integrations and the telephony
                    support of Dialogflow CX.</p>
