                    is <em>excellent</em>. It is almost 25 years old, but it <em>should</em> be required reading for
                    every professional working in a programming-related field. I <em>wish</em> that the outlined processes
                    were utilized more often and I firmly believe that they will result in higher quality programs with
                    far fewer bugs or defects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In short, the book is a comprehensive guide to peer reviews in software development, covering the
                    process, benefits, and best practices. It is grounded in experience and makes many references to
                    studies and other texts which support its claims.

                    The first two chapters strongly focus on selling the process to management by extolling its benefits,
                    while the rest of the book focuses on the process itself. Much time is spent explaining the different
                    types of reviews and how to perform them, with detailed instructions and examples for each step.

                    Based on his <a href="https://karlwiegers.com/books.html" target="_blank">personal website</a>, Karl
                    Wiegers has published a number of other books which I am looking forward to reading through.
