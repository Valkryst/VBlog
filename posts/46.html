                <p>
                    I do not recommend buying <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-1565-4" target="_blank">this book</a>.

                    <i>NIO</i> and <i>NIO.2</i> were never taught to me in university or in the vast majority of tutorials and code snippets that I
                    have been exposed to. This book was not the correct resource for me to learn about these parts of Java's API, as it seems to be more
                    of a reference manual. It includes explanations of key API classes, thorough documentation of important functions and constants,
                    and a seemingly excessive number of examples. Though these may help some readers, it was incredibly draining to read through
                    ~400 pages of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I hoped for was a book that explained the high-level concepts of <i>NIO</i> and <i>NIO.2</i>, brief explanations of
                    important classes, their functions and constants, how they relate to lower-level concepts and OS APIs, as well as a handful of
                    carefully curated examples. In hindsight, I would have been better-off reading through the official API documentation and
                    doing my own research.
