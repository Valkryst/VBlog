                <p>Place one or more eggs, in a single layer, into your air fryer and set it to 120°C (248°F) for 15-20 minutes. 15 minutes will result in a softer, more liquid yolk, whereas 20 minutes will result in a solid yolk. When the time has elapsed, place the egg(s) into a bowl of ice water or place them in a bowl and run it under cold water for at least 3 minutes before deshelling.</p>
                <p>These steps were performed with a 1200-watt air fryer.</p>
