                    <em>will</em> teach you everything you need to know to get started with network programming in Java. I recommend
                    this to anyone who does not know much about network programming, and to those who may have only taken a course or two
                    covering the topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the book does seem to be more of a reference manual at times, with dozens of fleshed out examples and thorough
                    explanations of constructors, constants, and methods, I suggest reading through it to become familiar with the covered
                    topics. This will allow you to more easily refer back to explanations and examples, in the future.

                    I have two gripes with this book, they are not major issues, but they are worth noting:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There is a <em>lot</em> of technical information in this book and it is not the type of book where you speed-read
                        through all the chapters in a day or two. I often found myself getting tired after a chapter or two, so it took
                        much longer to read than expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The book has a number of outdated references and statistics, as it has not been updated since 2013. As far as I am
                        aware, the book is still accurate overall, and it is still a good reference.
                    </li>
                </ol>
